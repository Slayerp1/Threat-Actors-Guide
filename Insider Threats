# Insider Threats

---

## What Are They?

Threats from **inside** your organization — employees, contractors, or partners with legitimate access.

---

## Key Characteristics

**Funding:** N/A — they already have access

**Skill Level:** Varies — often not technical hackers at all

**Motivation:** Usually NOT malicious — trying to be productive

**Danger:** Very high — they bypass perimeter defenses because they're already inside

---

## Two Types

**Intentional (Malicious):**
```
Disgruntled employee stealing data, sabotaging systems, selling access
```
When this happens: After being fired, passed over for promotion, or recruited by competitors.

---

**Unintentional (Accidental):**
```
Employee trying to "do good" but creating security risks
```
When this happens: Most of the time — this is far more common than malicious insiders.

---

## Primary Goals

**Malicious Insiders:**
```
Steal data for personal gain
Sabotage systems for revenge
Sell access to outside attackers
```

---

**Unintentional Insiders:**
```
Get the job done faster (bypass security controls)
Use unauthorized tools or services
Make honest mistakes (click phishing links, misconfigure systems)
```

---

## Common Example — Shadow IT

```
Technical employee sets up unauthorized server, network, or firewall rule
to "get the job done" faster without going through proper channels
```
Why it's dangerous:
- Creates undocumented vulnerabilities
- Not reviewed by security team
- When the person leaves → no one knows how to maintain or secure it
- Often discovered years later ("Who set this up?")

---

## How They Operate

- **Already have legitimate access** — no need to break in
- **Know internal systems** — know where the valuable data is
- **Bypass security tools** — firewalls don't stop internal threats
- **Actions look normal** — hard to distinguish from regular work

---

## How to Defend Against Them

- **Least privilege** — give users only the access they need
- **Monitor user activity** — watch for unusual data access patterns
- **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)** — prevent unauthorized data transfers
- **Offboarding procedures** — immediately revoke access when employees leave
- **Security awareness training** — reduce unintentional mistakes
- **Change management** — require approval for system changes
- **Regular access reviews** — verify who has access to what

---

## When to Worry About Insider Threats

- Always — every organization has insiders
- During layoffs or organizational changes
- When employees have access to sensitive data
- If you don't have proper offboarding procedures
- If there's no monitoring of user activity
- When technical staff make unauthorized changes
