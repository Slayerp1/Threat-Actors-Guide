# Shadow IT — A Common Insider Threat

---

## Definition

Technical employees/contractors deploy unauthorized systems, networks, firewall rules, or tools to "get the job done" faster without coordination.

---

## Why People Do It

```
Employee needs something done quickly
Official process is slow or bureaucratic
They set up their own solution without telling security team
```
When this happens: Very common in organizations with slow IT processes.

---

## Why It's Dangerous

**Creates undocumented vulnerabilities:**
```
Unauthorized servers, open ports, or firewall rules that security doesn't know about
```
What it means: Holes in your security that nobody is monitoring.

---

**Not reviewed by security team:**
```
No security assessment, no hardening, no monitoring
```
What it means: These systems are likely misconfigured and vulnerable.

---

**Knowledge leaves with the person:**
```
When the employee/contractor leaves → no one knows how to maintain or secure it
```
What it means: Orphaned systems that nobody understands or manages.

---

**Discovered years later:**
```
"Who set this up?" "Why is this server here?" "What does this firewall rule do?"
```
What it means: By the time it's found, it could have been exploited already.

---

## Real-World Impact

Many shadow IT setups become **forgotten backdoors** or **misconfigurations** that attackers discover and exploit.

---

## How to Prevent Shadow IT

**Change management process:**
```
Require approval for any new systems, services, or network changes
```
When to implement: Before it becomes a problem — make it part of company policy.

---

**Regular network scanning:**
```
Scan your network for unauthorized devices and services
```
When to do this: Weekly or monthly — catch shadow IT early.

---

**Asset inventory:**
```
Maintain a list of all authorized systems, services, and firewall rules
```
When to do this: Continuously — keep it up to date.

---

**Make the official process easier:**
```
If employees bypass security because the process is too slow, fix the process
```
When to do this: When you notice people going around the system.

---

**Education:**
```
Train employees on why unauthorized changes are dangerous
```
When to do this: During onboarding and regular security awareness training.

## When to Worry About Shadow IT

- Your IT request process is slow or frustrating
- You have technical employees with admin access
- Contractors have access to your infrastructure
- You haven't done a full network audit recently
- You find systems or rules nobody can explain
