# Nation-State Actors

---

## What Are They?

Government-backed hacking groups with unlimited resources.

---

## Key Characteristics

**Funding:** Highest — backed by government budgets

**Skill Level:** Highly skilled, highly organized

**Stealth:** Very stealthy and persistent

**Resources:** Unlimited — dedicated teams, custom tools, zero-days

---

## Primary Goals

**Espionage:**
```
Steal military secrets, government intel, diplomatic communications
```
When they do this: Ongoing — nation-states constantly spy on each other.

---

**Intellectual Property Theft:**
```
Steal R&D data, patents, trade secrets from companies
Example: Steal nuclear submarine designs instead of spending billions on their own research
```
When they do this: When it's cheaper to steal than to develop.

---

**Disruption of Critical Infrastructure:**
```
Target power grids, water systems, financial networks, hospitals
```
When they do this: During geopolitical conflicts or as preparation for future attacks.

---

**Building Botnets:**
```
Compromise thousands/hundreds of thousands of systems for future large-scale attacks
```
When they do this: Ongoing — stockpiling access for when they need it.

---

## How They Operate

- Use **custom malware** and **zero-day exploits**
- Can stay hidden in networks for **months or years** (APT — Advanced Persistent Threat)
- Target specific organizations with **spear-phishing** and **supply chain attacks**
- Often disguise their attacks to look like other threat actors

---

## How to Defend Against Them

- Network segmentation and zero-trust architecture
- Advanced threat detection (EDR/XDR)
- Regular threat hunting
- Patch management (reduce zero-day exposure)
- Employee security awareness training
- Focus on espionage protection for IP-heavy organizations

## When to Worry About Nation-States

- You work in defense, government, or critical infrastructure
- Your organization holds valuable intellectual property
- You're in aerospace, energy, finance, or healthcare
- You operate in geopolitically sensitive regions
