# Cyber Criminals

---

## What Are They?

Attackers motivated purely by **financial gain**.

---

## Key Characteristics

**Funding:** Well-funded (reinvest profits to improve attacks)

**Skill Level:** Varies — from script kiddies to highly skilled groups

**Motivation:** Money — steal it directly or through ransomware, fraud, etc.

**Organization:** Can range from lone hackers to organized crime syndicates

---

## Primary Goals

**Ransomware:**
```
Encrypt victim's files → Demand payment to decrypt
```
When they do this: Targeting any organization — hospitals, schools, businesses, governments.

---

**Direct Financial Theft:**
```
Steal money from bank accounts, payment systems, cryptocurrency wallets
```
When they do this: When they can access financial systems or credentials.

---

**Data Theft for Sale:**
```
Steal personal data, credit cards, medical records → Sell on dark web
```
When they do this: After breaching databases with valuable personal information.

---

**Business Email Compromise (BEC):**
```
Impersonate executives → Trick employees into transferring money
```
When they do this: Targeting companies with large financial transactions.

---

**Fraud:**
```
Identity theft, tax fraud, insurance fraud using stolen data
```
When they do this: After obtaining personal information from breaches.

---

## How They Operate

- Use **phishing** as the primary initial access method
- Buy/sell tools and access on **dark web marketplaces**
- Operate as **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** — rent attack tools to affiliates
- Reinvest profits into better tools and techniques
- Often target the **easiest victims** (poor security = easy money)

---

## How to Defend Against Them

- Email security and anti-phishing training
- Regular backups (offline/immutable for ransomware protection)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) everywhere
- Patch management
- Network monitoring for suspicious activity
- Incident response plan ready to execute

## When to Worry About Cyber Criminals

- Every organization is a target — they go for easy money
- You handle financial transactions or customer payment data
- You store personal information (PII, medical records)
- You have weak email security or no MFA
- Your backup strategy hasn't been tested
