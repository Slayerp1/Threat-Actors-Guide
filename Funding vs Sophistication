# Funding vs Sophistication

---

## Funding Levels

**Best-funded:** Nation-state actors (government budgets — unlimited)

**Also well-funded:** Cyber criminals (profit-driven reinvestment)

**Least funded:** Hacktivists (usually volunteer-based)

**N/A:** Insider threats (already have access — don't need funding)

---

## Key Insight

Funding does **NOT** always equal sophistication.

## Why Low Budget Can Still Be Dangerous

**Free/Open-Source Tools:**
```
Attackers use free tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite
```
These are the same tools security professionals use — freely available to anyone.

---

**Living-Off-the-Land Techniques:**
```
Use legitimate admin tools (PowerShell, WMI, PsExec) for malicious purposes
```
What it means: No need for custom malware — they use what's already on the system.
Why it's dangerous: Security tools often don't flag legitimate admin tools as threats.

---

**Exploiting Existing System Features:**
```
Abuse built-in OS features, scheduled tasks, registry, group policy
```
What it means: The attack uses the system's own tools against it — zero cost.

## Sophistication by Actor Type

**Nation-State:**
```
Sophistication: Very High
Funding: Very High
Custom zero-days, APT campaigns, supply chain attacks
```

---

**Cyber Criminals:**
```
Sophistication: Medium to High
Funding: High (profit-driven)
Ransomware-as-a-Service, phishing kits, dark web tools
```

---

**Hacktivists:**
```
Sophistication: Low to Medium
Funding: Low
DDoS tools, website defacement, publicly available exploits
```

---

**Insider Threats:**
```
Sophistication: Low (usually)
Funding: N/A
Already have access — don't need technical skills to cause damage
```

## When to Consider This

- Don't assume low-budget attackers are low-risk
- Defend against techniques, not just actor types
- Living-off-the-land attacks require behavioral detection, not just signature-based tools
- Even unsophisticated insiders can cause massive damage with legitimate access
